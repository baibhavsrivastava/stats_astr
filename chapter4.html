    <h4 id="acf">Autocorrelation Function</h4>
    <p>
        The autocorrelation function (ACF) is a measure of the correlation between a time series and a lagged
        version of
        itself. It is used to identify the presence of serial correlation in the data. The ACF is defined as:
        \[
        ACF(k) = \frac{\sum_{t=1}^{n-k} (X_t - \bar{X})(X_{t+k} - \bar{X})}{\sum_{t=1}^{n} (X_t - \bar{X})^2}
        \]
    </p>

    <h5>Interpretation:</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>If \( ACF(k) \) is close to 1, it indicates a strong positive autocorrelation at lag \( k \), meaning
            that
            values at time \( t \) and time \( t - k \) tend to move in the same direction.</li>
        <li>If \( ACF(k) \) is close to -1, it indicates a strong negative autocorrelation at lag \( k \), meaning
            that
            values at time \( t \) and time \( t - k \) tend to move in opposite directions.</li>
        <li>If \( ACF(k) \) is close to 0, it indicates no autocorrelation at lag \( k \), meaning that values at
            time
            \( t \) and time \( t - k \) are not correlated.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        ACF plots are commonly used to identify the order of autoregressive (AR) and moving average (MA) processes
        in
        time series models such as ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average). Peaks in the ACF plot can help
        determine the seasonal and non-seasonal components of the series.
    </p>
    <p>
        The ACF and Lag-k scatter plot for a noisy sinusoidal time series is shown below:
    </p>
    <div style="display: flex;">
        <div style="flex: 1;">
            <div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column;">
                <img src="sinusoidal_data.png" alt="sine" style="width: 100%;">
                <img src="acf.png" alt="acf" style="width: 100%;">
            </div>
        </div>
        <div style="flex: 2;">
            <img src="lag_plots.png" alt="lag" style="width: 70%;">
        </div>
    </div>

    One can clearly see the sinusoidal pattern in the time series data, and the corresponding peaks in the ACF plot
    at about a period of 4. Note that if you just had the data points (the noisy points), it would be very difficult to
    visually guess the periodicity in the data. The ACF plot helps in identifying the periodicity in the data. The Lag-k
    scatter plot also shows the correlation between the time series and its lagged version at different lags, showing
    strong correlation at lag 4 and its multiples. The negative peaks at 2 and 6 show the half-period effect of the
    sinusoidal pattern.

    <h4 id="pacf">Partial Autocorrelation Function</h4>
    <p>
        The partial autocorrelation function (PACF) is a measure of the correlation between a time series and a
        lagged
        version of itself, after removing the effects of the intermediate lags. It is used to identify the order of
        the
        autoregressive (AR) component in time series models. </p>

    <p>
        The PACF thus does not model the autocorrelation of the original time series, but
        gives insight into the time-scales responsible for the autocorrelated behavior.
    </p>

    <h4 id="arma">Autoregressive Moving Average (ARMA) Models</h4>

    <p>
        Autoregressive Moving Average (ARMA) models are a class of time series models that combine autoregressive
        (AR)
        and moving average (MA) components to describe the structure of a time series. ARMA models are used to
        forecast
        future values based on past observations and to understand the underlying patterns and trends in the data.
    </p>

    <p>
        An ARMA(p, q) model is represented by the following equation:
        \[X_i = \alpha_1 X_{i-1} + \ldots + \alpha_p X_{i-p} + \varepsilon_i + \beta_1 \varepsilon_{i-1} + \ldots +
        \beta_q \varepsilon_{i-q}\]

        where \(X_i\) is the value of the time series at time \(i\), \(\alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_p\) are the
        autoregressive
        parameters, \(\varepsilon_i\) is the white noise error term at time \(i\), and \(\beta_1, \ldots, \beta_q\)
        are
        the
        moving average parameters.
    </p>

    <p>
        The parameters \( p \) and \( q \) are determined based on the autocorrelation function (ACF) and partial
        autocorrelation function (PACF) of the time series data. The AR component captures the long-term
        dependencies in
        the data, while the MA component accounts for short-term fluctuations and random noise.
    </p>

    <h4 id="arima">Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) Models</h4>

    <p>
        Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models are a class of time series models that combine
        autoregressive (AR), differencing (I), and moving average (MA) components to describe the structure of a
        time
        series. ARIMA models are used when the data is non-stationary, i.e. has systematic trends or seasonality
        that
        need to be removed before modeling.
    </p>

    <p>
        An ARIMA(p, d, q) model has \(p\) parameters giving the autoregressive dependence of the current value on
        past
        measured values, \(d\) parameters giving the number of differencing operations needed to account for drifts
        in
        mean values (\(d = 1\) corresponds to the random walk), and \(q\) parameters
        giving the autoregressive dependence on past noise values.
    </p>

    <h4 id="fourier">Fourier Analysis</h4>

    <p>
        Fourier Power Spectrum Analysis is a technique used in time series analysis to decompose a signal into its
        frequency components. It is based on the Fourier transform, which transforms a time-domain signal into its
        frequency-domain representation.
    </p>

    <h5>Fourier Transform:</h5>

    <p>
        The Fourier transform converts a time series \( y(t) \) into its frequency-domain representation \( Y(f) \)
        using the following equation:
    </p>

    <p style="text-align: center;">
        \( Y(f) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} y(t) \cdot e^{-2\pi i f t} \, dt \)
    </p>

    <p>
        where \( f \) is the frequency.
    </p>

    <h5>Power Spectrum:</h5>

    <p>
        The power spectrum represents the distribution of power (or energy) of the signal across different
        frequencies.
        It is calculated as the squared magnitude of the Fourier transform:
    </p>

    <p style="text-align: center;">
        \( P(f) = |Y(f)|^2 \)
    </p>

    <p>
        The power spectrum provides information about the dominant frequencies present in the signal and their
        relative
        strengths.
    </p>

    <p>
        Fourier Power Spectrum can be used to analyze periodic or oscillatory signals. It helps in identifying the
        dominant frequencies in the data, detecting periodic patterns, and understanding the underlying processes.
    </p>

    <p>
        The Fourier Power Spectrum of a noisy double sine wave signal is shown below:
    <div style="display: flex;">
        <img src="double_sine_wave.png" style="width: 50%;" alt="double">
        <img src="fourier_power_spectrum.png" style="width: 50%;" alt="fourier">
    </div>

    One can see the two dominant peaks in the power spectrum corresponding to the two sine wave components of the
    signal.
    </p>

    <h3 id="uneven">Unevenly Spaced Data</h3>

    <h4 id="lomb-scargle">Lomb-Scargle Periodogram</h4>

    <p>
        The Lomb-Scargle Periodogram is a method used for detecting periodic signals in unevenly sampled time series
        data. It is particularly useful in astronomy and other fields where observations may be irregularly spaced
        or
        have gaps.
    </p>

    <p>
        The Lomb-Scargle periodogram computes the power spectrum of a time series, similar to the Fourier power
        spectrum, but it is optimized for unevenly sampled data. It calculates the power at each frequency \( f \)
        using
        the following equation:

        \[ P_{\text{LS}}(f) = \frac{1}{2\sigma^2} \left[ \frac{\left(\sum_i X_i \cos(2\pi f t_i)\right)^2}{\sum_i
        \cos^2(2\pi f (t_i - \tau) )} + \frac{\left(\sum_i X_i \sin(2\pi f t_i)\right)^2}{\sum_i \sin^2(2\pi f (t_i
        - \tau) )} \right] \]

        where:

    <ul>
        <li> \( P(f) \) is the power at frequency \( f \).</li>
        <li> \( X_i \) are the data values at time \( t_i \).</li>
        <li> \( \sigma^2 \) is the variance of the data.</li>
        <li> \( \tau \) is defined as
            \[ \tan(4\pi f \tau) = \frac{\sum_i \sin(4\pi f t_i)}{\sum_i \cos(4\pi f t_i)} \]
        </li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
        The Lomb-Scargle periodogram is used to identify periodic signals in time series data, even when the data
        are irregularly sampled.
    </p>

    <h4 id="wavelet">Wavelet Analysis</h4>

    <p>
        Wavelet analysis is a powerful technique used for analyzing time series data at different scales or
        resolutions. It is particularly useful for detecting localized patterns, abrupt changes, and transient
        phenomena in the data. The wavelet transform, like the Fourier transform, translates the information of a
        time series into another space through convolution with an orthonormal basis function. But unlike the
        Fourier transform, the wavelet transform is well-suited to nonstationary phenomena, particularly if the
        variations occur on a range of temporal scales or over small portions of the time series.
    </p>

    <p>
        Wavelet analysis decomposes a time series into its time-frequency components using wavelet functions, which
        are mathematical functions that oscillate at different frequencies and are localized in both time and
        frequency domains. The wavelet transform of \(X_i\) at scale \(s\) and time \(t\) is given by:

        \[ W(s, t) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{s}} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} X_i g\left(\frac{t - t'}{s}\right) \, dt' \]

        where \(g\) is a simple basis function called the mother wavelet. The wavelet transform provides a
        time-frequency representation of the data, allowing for the detection of localized features and time-varying
        patterns.
