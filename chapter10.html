    <h3 id="definitions">Basic Definitions</h3>

    <h4>Truncation:</h4>

    <p>
        Truncation occurs when the data are only available for a certain range of values, and observations outside
        this
        range are not included in the dataset. Truncation can be left-truncated, right-truncated, or
        double-truncated
        depending on whether the observations are missing from the lower, upper, or both ends of the range.
    </p>

    <h4>Censoring:</h4>

    <p>
        Censoring refers to the situation where the exact value of a variable of interest is not observed but is
        known
        to lie within certain bounds. There are two types of censoring:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Right Censoring:</strong> Occurs when the data are only partially observed up to a certain
            point.
            The exact value is known to be greater than or equal to a specified threshold.</li>
        <li><strong>Left Censoring:</strong> Occurs when the data are only partially observed down to a certain
            point.
            The exact value is known to be less than or equal to a specified threshold.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Survival Function:</h4>

    <p>
        The survival function, denoted by \( S(x) \), represents the probability that an object has a value above
        some
        specified level. For censored data, \( S(x) \) gives the probability that an object has a value above some
        specified level \( x \) given that we have observed values up to \( x \). Mathematically:
        \[ S(x) = P(X > x) = 1 - F(x) \]
        where \( F(x) \) is the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the variable \( X \).
    </p>

    <h4>Hazard Rate:</h4>

    <p>
        The hazard rate, denoted by \( h(x) \), is the instantaneous rate at which events occur at time \( x \)
        given
        that they have not occurred up to that time. It is defined as the ratio of the probability density function
        (PDF) to the survival function:
        \[ h(x) = \frac{f(x)}{S(x)} = -\frac{d}{dx} \ln(S(x)) \]
    </p>

    <h3 id="kaplan-meier">Kaplan-Meier Estimator</h3>

    <p>
        The Kaplan-Meier estimator is a non-parametric method used to estimate the survival function from censored
        data.
    </p>

    <p>
        Given a set of \( n \) observed survival times \( x_1, x_2, ..., x_n \) with corresponding censoring
        indicators \( \delta_1, \delta_2, ..., \delta_n \), where \( \delta_i = 1 \) if the event is observed and \(
        \delta_i = 0 \) if it is censored, the cumulative Hazard function (for left censored data) is defined as:
        \[\hat{H}_{KM}(x) = \sum_{x_i \geq x} \frac{\delta_i}{n_i} \]
    </p>

    <p>
        The ratio \(\delta_i/N_i\) is the conditional probability that an object with value above \(x\) will occur
        at \(x\). The Kaplan-Meier estimator estimates the survival function \( S(x) \) as follows:
        \[ \hat{S}_{KM}(x) = \prod_{x_i \geq x} (1 - \frac{\delta_i}{n_i}) \]
    </p>

    <p>
        If the censoring is random, the Kaplan-Meier estimator is an unbiased estimator of the true survival
        function.
    </p>

    <h3 id="cox">Cox Regression</h3>
    <p>
        Cox Regression, also known as Cox Proportional Hazards Model, is a semi-parametric method used for
        analyzing the association between the hazard rate and covariates in survival analysis.
    </p>

    <p>
        The Cox model assumes that the hazard ratio is constant over time, but allows for the covariates to have a
        multiplicative effect on the baseline hazard function.
    </p>

    <p>
        The hazard rate has an exponential dependence on the covariates:
        \[ h(y|x) = h_0(y) \cdot \exp(\beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + ... + \beta_p x_p) \]

        where \( h(y|x) \) is the hazard function at time \( y \) for a subject with covariates \( x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_p
        \), \( h_0(y) \) is the baseline hazard function, and \( \beta_1, \beta_2, \ldots, \beta_p \) are the regression
        coefficients corresponding to the covariates.
    </p>

    </p>

    <h4>Assumptions:</h4>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Proportional Hazards Assumption:</strong> The hazard ratio for any two individuals remains
            constant over time.</li>
        <li><strong>Independence:</strong> The survival times of different individuals are independent of each
            other.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        The coefficients \( \beta_1, \beta_2, ..., \beta_p \) in Cox Regression represent the log hazard ratios
        associated with each covariate. A positive coefficient indicates an increased "risk" of the event, while a
        negative coefficient indicates a decreased "risk", holding other variables constant.
    </p>

    <h3 id="lbw">Lynden-Bell and Woodroofe Estimator</h3>

    <p>
        The Lynden-Bell and Woodroofe Estimator is a non-parametric method used for estimating the survival function in
        the case of truncated data.
    </p>

    <p>
        The Lynden-Bell and Woodroofe Estimator \( \hat{S}(t) \) is defined as:

        \[ \hat{S} = \prod_{i:x_i \leq x} \left(1 - \frac{\delta_i}{n_i}\right) \] where \( x_i \) are the observed
        survival times, \( \delta_i \) are the censoring indicators, and \( n_i \) is the number of observations at
        time \( x_i \). This is very similar to the Kaplan-Meier estimator, but it is adapted to handle truncated
        data. </p>

    <p>
        The LBW estimator assumes that the underlying distribution of survival times is known for the entire
        population, but only a truncated sample is observed. It adjusts for truncation by incorporating
        information about the truncation point and the distribution of survival times beyond that point. The KM
        estimator, on the other hand, calculates the survival probabilities based only on the observed survival
        times and censoring indicators. If there is truncation in the data, the KM estimator may provide biased
        estimates, especially if the observed sample is not representative of the entire population.
