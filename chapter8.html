    <h3 id="csr">Complete Spatial Randomness</h3>

    <p>
        In a spatial point process, complete spatial randomness refers to the absence of any systematic arrangement or
        clustering of points in the study area. It implies that the occurrence of points is unpredictable and follows a
        Poisson distribution with a constant intensity \( \lambda \).
    </p>
    <p>
        The probability of finding \( n \) points in a region \( A \) is given by the Poisson distribution:
        \[
        P(N(A) = n) = \frac{e^{-\lambda |A|} (\lambda |A|)^n}{n!}
        \]
        where \( N(A) \) is the number of points in region \( A \), \( |A| \) is the area of region \( A \), and \( n \)
        is the number of points in region \( A \). For a bin size of \(\pi r^2\), the intensity \( \lambda \) is given
        by:
        \[ \lambda = \frac{(N-1)\pi r^2}{A}\]
    </p>
    <p>
        The probability of finding a point in the annular region \(2\pi r dr\) at a distance \( r \) from a point is
        given by:
        \[ f = P(\text{Zero points in } \pi r^2) \cdot P(\text{One point in } 2\pi r dr) \]
        \[ f = e^{-\pi r^2(n-1)/A}\cdot\frac{2\pi r(n-1)dr}{A} \]
        But for \(n \rightarrow \infty\), \(n \approx n-1). So we get:
        \[ f = e^{-\pi r^2n/A}\cdot\frac{2\pi r n dr}{A} \]
    </p>
    <p>
        Thus, the CDF for a Completely Spatially Random point process is given by:
        \[ G_{CSR}(r) = \int_0^r f = 1 - e^{-\pi r^2 n/A} \]
    </p>

    <h3 id="spa_auto_corr">Spatial Autocorrelation</h3>
    <p>
        In spatial statistics, autocorrelation refers to the correlation between observations at different locations in
        a spatial dataset. Spatial autocorrelation specifically measures the relationship between the values of a
        variable at nearby locations.
    </p>

    <p>
        Using Dr Hartigan's favourite example, consider a certain amount of soil thrown over the class table. The
        distribution of soil particles is random, but if you look closely, you will see that the particles are not
        randomly distributed. There are clusters of particles close to each other, and empty spaces between them. This
        is an example of spatial autocorrelation. The presence of soil particles at one location is correlated with the
        presence of soil particles at nearby locations. Studying spatial autocorrelation can help us understand the
        "typical length scales" of the distribution of soil particles.
    </p>

    <h4>Measures of Spatial Autocorrelation:</h4>

    <p>
        Various statistical measures can quantify spatial autocorrelation, including:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Moran's I:</strong> Measures the overall spatial autocorrelation in a dataset. It is defined as:
        </li>
    </ul>

    \[ I = \frac{1}{W(d)}\frac{\sum_{i=1\neq j}^n \sum_{j=1\neq i}^n w_{ij}(d)(x_i - \bar{x})(x_j -
    \bar{x})}{\frac{1}{n}\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i - \bar{x})^2}} \]
    <p>
        where \( x_i \) is the value of the variable at location \( i \), \( \bar{x} \) is the mean value of the
        variable, \( w_{ij}(d) \) is a matrix of kernel weights, and \( W(d) \) is the sum of \( w_{ij}(d) \).
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Geary's C:</strong> Similar to Moran's I but focuses on local spatial autocorrelation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Variogram:</h4>

    <p>
        The variogram is a graphical tool used to assess spatial dependence in a dataset. It measures how the variance
        of a variable changes with distance between points. The variogram function, denoted by \( \gamma(d) \), is
        calculated as the half of the expected squared difference between the values of the variable at two locations
        separated by a distance \( d \):
        \[ \gamma(d) = \frac{1}{2n(d)}\sum_{i=1}^{n(d)}[z(x_i) - z(x_i + d)]^2 \]
        where \( z(x_i) \) is the value of the variable at location \( x_i \), and \( n(d) \) is the number of pairs of
        points separated by distance \( d \).
    </p>

    <h3 id="kriging">Kriging</h3>

    <p>
        Kriging is a geostatistical interpolation technique used to estimate the value of a spatial variable at
        unmeasured locations based on values observed at nearby locations.
    </p>

    <p>
        Kriging predicts values at unsampled locations by estimating the spatial autocorrelation between sampled
        locations. It accounts for both the spatial trend and the spatial dependence structure of the variable being
        modeled.
    </p>

    <h4>Types of Kriging:</h4>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Ordinary Kriging:</strong> Assumes a constant mean value and estimates the spatial autocorrelation
            using weighted averages of nearby points.</li>
        <li><strong>Simple Kriging:</strong> Assumes a constant mean value and estimates the spatial autocorrelation
            using weighted averages of nearby points, with an additional constant term for the nugget effect.</li>
        <li><strong>Universal Kriging:</strong> Allows for a spatially varying mean value, incorporating a trend surface
            into the model.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Kriging Process:</h4>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Variogram Modeling:</strong> The spatial dependence structure is characterized by modeling the
            variogram, which describes how the variance of the variable changes with distance.</li>
        <li><strong>Kriging Estimation:</strong> Using the variogram model, weights are calculated for neighboring
            sample points to estimate values at unsampled locations.</li>
        <li><strong>Prediction:</strong> The estimated values are used to predict the variable's values at unsampled
            locations, often with associated prediction intervals.</li>
    </ol>
